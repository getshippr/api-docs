#### API Keys

In your [dashboard's API Key section](https://www.getshippr.com/apikeys), we provide your account with an API key and application ID
that you have to use to authenticate a call to our servers

```js
const client = shippr("APPID", "APIKEY")
```

#### Domains whitelisting

On top of this, we ask you to provide a list of domain to whitelists. This will reject any HTTP/WS calls
made from another domain than the one you specificall granted.

<Note>Don't forget to allow localhost for testing!</Note>


#### CSRF protection

Soon!


#### Generating User IDs

In order to authenticate/track/log, we assign a random RFC version 4 UUID to any request to our servers, which is internally used as a user ID

<Note>You can pass your own identifier if necessary</Note>
