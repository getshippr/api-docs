## Presence indicator 101

Presence indicators comes quickly to mind when it comes to real time application.
A presence indicator is what you see on google docs for instance: a list of users 
that are currently browsing the page.

<Note>As of today, our built in components only supports React but you can easily adapt it to other Framework. [Contact us!](https://join.slack.com/t/shippr-workspace/shared_invite/zt-223vp3dj8-wYjTq3RfENI0HxCrNGa0ng)</Note>


### What do you need


1. Your [Application ID and API key](https://www.getshippr.com/apikeys)

<Warning>Don't forget to whitelist your domain if you are using your API key in production</Warning>

2. A channel name

To instanciate your presence indicator, you will need a channel name (which will under the hood indentify your websocket connection)

example: "myawesomepage"

3. Shippr/react

Shippr has a collection of widgets on top of its infrastructure.

<CodeGroup>
```js YARN
yarn add @shippr/react
```
```js NPM
npm install @shippr/react
```
</CodeGroup>

### Simple mode

This widget has multiple [options](https://github.com/getshippr/shippr-react/blob/main/react/components/ChannelPresence/index.tsx), let's start with a simple one.

```jsx
<ChannelPresence
    channelId="myawesomepage"
    apiKey="APIKEY"
    appId="APPID"
    mode="simple"
/>
```

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/presence/simple.png" />
</Frame>

#### Display for anonymous users 
If your users are anonymous but still want to display fake images, we provide avatars

```jsx
<ChannelPresence
    channelId="myawesomepage"
    apiKey="APIKEY"
    appId="APPID"
    mode="stacked"
/>
```

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/presence/stacked.png" />
</Frame>


#### Display for known users 

If your users are not anonymous, you can instantiate the widget with a user identifier, like a user ID or an email. This then can be used to display actual users avatar or names. Here how you can do it:

```jsx
<ChannelPresence
    channelId="myawesomepage"
    apiKey="APIKEY"
    appId="APPID"
    mode="stacked"
    userId={currentUser.id}
    customUserLayout={(user) => {
      const imgUrl = imageFromUserId(p.userId);
      return <img src={imgUrl} />
    }}
/>
```
You can customize the user's vignette with `customUserLayout`.

<Note>
Here, `imageFromUserId` is your own logic to retrieve the user's image URL from the user Id.
We recommand to pre-load this mapping on page load
</Note>

### Advanced mode

The previous mode is usually too simple. You also want to know the number of connection and the last time a specific user has accessed the document.

This part is tricky to implement because you need to persist the data somewhere, usually a database. Fortunately, Shippr takes care of this.
The `users` variable contains all the information you need:

```
export type UserPresence = {
  userId: string;
  state: "connected" | "disconnected";
  updatedAt: number;
  connectionCount: number;
};
````

If you enable the tooltip, you can have access to a templated display


```jsx
<ChannelPresence
    channelId="myawesomepage"
    apiKey="APIKEY"
    appId="APPID"
    mode="stacked"
    userId={currentUser.id}
    showTooltip={true}
    tooltipPosition={'left}
    customUserLayout={(user) => {
      const imgUrl = imageFromUserId(p.userId);
      return <img src={imgUrl} />
    }}
/>
```

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/presence/tooltip.png" />
</Frame>

<Note>We persist any users that accessed the ressource, and maintain the current state: connected or not. If you want to only display connected users, your can use the `filterOnActive` attribute</Note>

### Full customization

You can customize your widget with 3 different attributes

- `customUserLayout` will overide the user's picture
- `customTooltip` will overide the tooltip
- `customLayout` will overide the **entire** component

### Events

- `onConnect` will be triggered when a new user joins the page.
For instance, you could send a slack notification or an inapp notification notifying that a specific user is on a page (a contract to sign for instance!) 

- `onDisconnect` will be triggered when a user leaves the page.



### How is the state maintained

- **user.state = 'connected'**

Connected means a connection was instantiated: the user opened the page and left it open.

<Note>If the user kept the page opened and is on another tab, the state will still be connected</Note>

- **user.state = 'disconnected'**

Disconnected means the connection previously opened has closed. This can happen in different ways:
1. The window closed
2. The page changed
3. A backend error occured (we disconnect as a safe guard)
