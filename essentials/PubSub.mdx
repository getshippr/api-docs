### Basic usage

Shippr comes with its own pub/sub low latency infrastructure.

Our client library allows you to stream and receive events in a very simple way, 
without worrying about infrastructure, transport (http/websockets/sse/etc.), security and distribution.

    ```js pub.ts
import shippr from "@shippr/client"

const client = shippr("APPID", "APIKEY")
client.publish("my-channel", { data: "something happened" })
      
    ```
    ```js sub.ts

    import shippr from "@shippr/client"

    const client = shippr("APPID", "APIKEY")
    const myWatcher = await client.subscribe("my-channel")
    myWatcher.on((data, err) => {
        doSomethingFun()
    })

          ```
