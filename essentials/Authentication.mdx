## API Keys

In your [dashboard's API Key section](https://www.getshippr.com/apikeys), we provide your account with an API key and application ID
that you have to use to authenticate a call to our servers

```js
const client = shippr("APPID", "APIKEY")
```


## Websocket connections

`@shippr/client` is built on top of `@shippr/supersocket` - a drop in replacement for our Websocket.

The Websocket implementation has known "issues": connection droping, lack of standardisation, debugging difficult and well as lack of security features.
A few NPM package already exists about those issues but most of the are unmaintained so we decided to build [our own](https://github.com/getshippr/supersocket) (give us a star!)


### Domains whitelisting

On top of this, we ask you to provide a list of domain to whitelists. This will reject any HTTP/WS calls
made from another domain than the one you specificall granted.

<Note>Don't forget to allow localhost for testing!</Note>

## Authentication

### Authentication with cookie base authentication

```jsx
import shippr from '@shippr/client'

const shipprClient = shippr("appId", "apiKey", { 
    wsOptions: {
        authenticate: {
            endpoint: "/your-auth-endpoint-api",
            headers: {
                "crsf cookie": value,
            },
        },
    }
})
```

### Authentication with Handshake pattern

```jsx
import shippr from '@shippr/client'

const shipprClient = shippr("appId", "apiKey", { 
    wsOptions: {
        authenticate: {
            endpoint: "/your-auth-endpoint-api",
            data: {
                "client id": value,
                "client pwd": value,
            },
        },
    }
})
```

## Encryption

Encryption/decryption is possible, through the [Cypher algorithm](https://cryptojs.gitbook.io/docs/#ciphers)

```jsx
import shippr from '@shippr/client'

const shipprClient = shippr("appId", "apiKey", { 
    wsOptions: {
        encryptKey: "my secret key",
    }
})
```

## Generating User IDs

In order to authenticate/track/log, we assign a random RFC version 4 UUID to any request to our servers, which is internally used as a user ID

<Note>You can pass your own identifier if necessary</Note>

 ## Inside your react application

 You can pass the same parameter to the `@shippr/react` client:


```jsx
import shippr from '@shippr/client'

export default function App({ Component, pageProps: { ...pageProps } }) {
  return (
    <ShipprProvider appId={"your_app_id"} apiKey={"your_api_key"} options={{
        authenticate: {
            endpoint: "/your-auth-endpoint-api",
            headers: {
                'crsf cookie': "value",
            },
        },
    }}>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ShipprProvider>
  )
}
```
