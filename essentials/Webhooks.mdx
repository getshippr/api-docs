### Basic usage

Shippr comes with its own webhook infrastructure that allows you to send any payload to Shippr and it will take care of forwarding it.

```
https://push.getshippr.com/hooks/YOUR_CHANNEL?apiKey=YOUR_KEY&appId=YOUR_APP
```

<CodeGroup>
      ```sh using CURL
      curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"bar": "foo"}' "https://push.getshippr.com/hooks/my-channel-test?apiKey=YOUR_KEY&appId=YOUR_APP"
      ```
      ```js using fetch
fetch(`https://push.getshippr.com/hooks/${channelId}?apiKey=${apiKey}&appId=${appId}`,{
        method: "POST",
        headers: {
            "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
            Accept: "application/json",
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({ foo: "bar"}),
    });

          ```
    </CodeGroup>
### Authentication

In your [dashboard's API Key section](https://www.getshippr.com/apikeys), we provide your account with an API key and application ID


### Accessing those events

By using `@shippr/client`, you can access webhook realtime anywhere in your code

#### Example with slack
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/slack_example.png" />
</Frame> 
All slack events triggered by your buttons can be received via

 ```js

    import shippr from "@shippr/client"

    const client = shippr("APPID", "APIKEY")
    const myWatcher = await client.subscribe("my-channel")
    myWatcher.on((data, err) => {
        doSomethingFun()
    })

          ```
